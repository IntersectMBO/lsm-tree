# A fast, space efficient Bloom filter implementation

Copyright 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 Bryan O'Sullivan <bos@serpentine.com>.

This package provides both mutable and immutable Bloom filter data
types, along with a family of hash function and an easy-to-use
interface.

To build:

    cabal install bloomfilter

For examples of usage, see the Haddock documentation and the files in
the examples directory.
