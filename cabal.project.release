-- this prevents occurence of Hackage bloomfilter anywhere in the install plan
-- that is overconstraining, as we'd only need to make sure lsm-tree
-- doesn't depend on Hackage bloomfilter.
-- Luckily, bloomfilter is not commonly used package, so this is good enough.

-- TODO: it is slightly unfortunate that one has to manually remove this file

-- possible to have conditionals on package flags in a project file. Otherwise,
-- we could add a conditional on (+serialblockio) to remove this import automatically.
